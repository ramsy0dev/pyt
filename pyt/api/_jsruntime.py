"""Detect a JavaScript runtime for shelling out to BotGuard / PO-token
generator scripts.

Looks up ``node``, ``bun``, and ``deno`` (in that order — Node has the
largest ecosystem and is what most YouTube generators target). The
order is preference, not capability: any of the three can run a
modern ES2020+ script.

Why a JS runtime at all? PO tokens are produced by a BotGuard JS
challenge. Re-implementing it in pure Python means tracking Google's
private API in two languages instead of one. Shelling out to a real
JS engine lets us reuse the existing community generators
(``bgutil-pot``, ``youtube-po-token-generator``, etc.) without
shipping a JS interpreter.

The detection result is cached at module level so repeated lookups
during a single process are free. ``invalidate()`` is provided for
tests that mock ``shutil.which``.
