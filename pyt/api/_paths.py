"""Managed binary location for pyt-installed tools.

The ``doctor`` command can download ffmpeg and realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan
on the user's behalf. We drop them in ``~/.pyt/bin/`` rather than
asking users to mess with their shell PATH — and prepend that
directory to ``os.environ["PATH"]`` at import time so subsequent
``shutil.which("ffmpeg")`` calls (and any subprocess we spawn) pick
the managed copy up automatically.

The mutation is process-local: it never touches the user's shell
profile or system PATH.
